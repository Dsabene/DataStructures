/**
 * Customer.java - represents a customer at a chinese takeout restaurant.
 *
 * Goal:
 * The goal of this endeavor is to produce a working program. The
 * objective is to demonstrate techniques, specifically data structures
 * learned in this semester, as proof of learning.
 *
 * Scope:
 * The scope of work is to produce a small program, using sufficient
 * data to demonstrate the program efficacy, but no more. 'Customersâ€™
 * will not number over 100, and dishes will not number more than 15.

 * Team Members:
 * Dennis Sabene
